	                      classes.

	                  together the contributions made by my group member.

	                      on two different systems (portable laptop and desktop
	                       at home) locally, and pulling/pushing from/to those
	                       branches remotely.

	                      sprint 2.
	What I will do today: Add the user story for the triangle shape.
	Obstacles I face: Making the decision between which style of triangle to
                      create, and ensuring compatibility with the architecture
                      we leverage.

Oct 24,2024
	What I did yesterday: Add the user story for the triangle shape; push user

	                      determining what kind of triangle (equilateral,
	                      scalene, isosceles) to initially implement. Note:
	                      later, consider allowing the user to make this choice
	                       of triangle depending on whether they use their
	                       ctrl, shift, and/or alt keys.

	                      architecture.

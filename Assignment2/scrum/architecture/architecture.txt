# Please discuss your architectural decisions below.

High Level Architecture:

	MVC
	To keep the code simple, a partial MVC was implemented.
	
	Model
	The Model captures enough information to re-draw the sketch of
	the user.

	Circle: Represent circle shape.
	Rectangle: Represent rectangle shape.
	Point: Represent a coordinate in 2D.
	Shape: An abstract class represents different shapes. (to be implemented)
	PaintModel: Store and manage the data for points and shapes.

	View+Controller
	There is a View class as well as a few, what we call, paintView components.
	The View class containing the BorderPane as well as containing all of its components.
	View components are meant to be contained in the main View.
	Examples of paintView components are PaintPanel and ShapeChooserPanel.
	The View class, and paintView components all implements their own controller.
	For example, the PaintPanel listens to its own MouseEvents.
	This is instead of separating out the Controller from the View. This choice
	was made to simplify the code, yet still keep it modular and clear.
	Each paintView component can see the containing View as well as the Model
	as appropriate. This means that each paintView component can speak to the
	other paintView components. An example of this is when the ShapeChooserPanel
	buttons are clicked, resulting in a mode change in the PaintPanel.

	View: The main container that holds all paintView components
	ShapeChooserPanel: The controller that handles shape selection and
	updates the current drawing mode.
	PaintPanel: The canvas paintView where shapes are drawn and displayed.
	Also handles MouseEvent as part of the controller.
	Paint: Initializes the model (data) and paintView (UI) to start the paint
	program.

	Class Interaction by MVC:
	View and model components work together trough shared references.
    For example, PaintPanel and ShapeChooserPanel interact with the
    model directly by fetching data(shape list). When the user
    interacts with the ShapeChooserPanel like click on the shape they
    want, this event triggers an update to the Controller PaintPanel.
    PaintPanel then draws the selected shape and update it to the paintView,
    and the paintView in turn displays drawing to users.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
do you do something interesting to fix the association between the 
ShapeChooser and the PaintPanel? How about the PaintModel, something
is clearly wrong with it. Can you come up with a better architecture?

1.Association between ShapeChooserPanel and PaintPanel:
Originally, the ShapeChooserPanel will communicate with PaintPanel by calling
methods in the View, which causes MVC intertwined in a complex way.
Instead, have the controller in ShapeChooserPanel and PaintPanel call the
PaintModel directly, which help maintain and extend the system.

2. PaintModel should work on all shapes:
Add an abstract Shape class for modeling all shapes such as circles,
rectangles, squares, etc.

3. Make PaintModel class manage all shapes instead of only ArrayList<Circles>
so that the model data can store all shapes regardless of type.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

DESIGN PATTERNS USED
	discuss it below. Only add design patterns if they simplify and improve
	the code. I see at least two that would greatly improve code. (Factory, Command and Builder)
		
	Strategy: In PaintPanel class, the Strategy Pattern allows the panel to draw shapes
	          based on different shapes, which means each type of shape has a corresponding
	          algorithm.(In the switch conditional block)
	Command:  In View class, every event is directly executed other than encapsulated as a
	          command, while the command determines whether users opts out of the canvas and
	          controls the platform to exit. In the future, our team will implement undo
	          functionality to store user action events into commands so that by withdrawing
	          the latest command bar allows the user to withdraw the drawn graphic.
	Singleton: The existence of only one instance of PaintModel ensures that other classes
	           (e.g. PaintPanel, ShapeChooserPanel) will only get a unique instance of the
	           same class. Without Singleton Pattern, multiple instances will be instantiated
	           whenever the model is used, which would be error-prone and cost a lot more
	           memory space.
	Composite: There are variable instances ArrayList<Point> and ArrayList<Shape> being used
	           in PaintModel Class. So the PaintModel is actually composited with Point Class,
	           Circle Class, Rectangle and Square Class. Also, In ScribblePanel Class, there is
	           a new HBox being created so that HBox composites nodes like ScribblePanel. The
	           stage contains the scene(scene is created in start method) is also a composite
	           pattern design.
	Factory: ShapeFactory(Have not been implemented yet). Use it as an abstract class for all
	         shapes.
	Builder: Not yet implemented. Can consider use builder pattern in the future.
	Observer/Observable: PaintPanel is the Observer, PaintModel is the Observable. When PaintModel
	changes, it automatically notifies PaintPanel.


OTHER ARCHITECTURE DISCUSSIONS
    1. For future sprints implementation: Use factory, command and builder patterns.
    2. How a developer adds a new shape feature such as Rectangle to the existing
       code?
       First, create the Rectangle class for modeling the features such as width and height.
       Second, add the rectangle model into PaintModel since PaintModel is an observable.
       In this way, changes to rectangle model can be communicated to other classes such as
       controller PaintPanel. Third, integrate Rectangle into PaintPanel so that PaintPanel
       can handle users mouse events to draw rectangles and update canvas.
